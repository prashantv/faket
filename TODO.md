## TODO

## Caller information

 * Check how caller information is reported when `t.Helper` and `t.Cleanup` are mixed.
 * Provide ability to get structured information for logs which include caller, function, etc.
   * Clean up the API around gettling logs (testing log output format, list, string, etc).
